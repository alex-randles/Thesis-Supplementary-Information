"2023/03/16 6:03:57 PM GMT+1","Yes","It is explained and declared that they followed the best practices.","No","-","Yes","look 5","Yes","Look 5","There are some classes floating around in your widoco page. I think you should make the proper connections between them and I didn't understand the MappingRefinement relation with Agent. The relation is not on the ontology or floating representation does not show it as well. So in general I would check the relations and concepts there."
"2023/03/21 9:33:05 AM GMT+1","Yes","the ontology seems to be  following the best practices in methodologies relevant to the ontology space.","No","sound methodology","Yes","I'd suggest that SHACL is considered instead of RDF constructs to define and capture violations. SHACL is being widely used in industry for this aspect.","No","documentation is well written",""
"2023/03/26 10:46:03 PM GMT+1","Yes","It follows well established methods for developing and iteratively improving the concepts based on application.","No","I think the current iteration is sufficient for the task.","Yes","Some relationships are probable to have more information associated with the context. In such cases, the target of these should not be a data property, but instead should be a concept that can have more information associated with it. For example, used Query relates to a Query which may have an author or a version, and requirements satisfaction could be variances in states (e.g. none, somewhat, almost, fully), or used Tool which can be associated with more information for the tool.","No","I think the current iteration is sufficient for the task.","No."

"2023/04/19 12:27:49 PM GMT+1","Yes","Use of both methodologies and state of the art ontology validation tools","Yes","Apply FAIR checker software to the ontology metadata, check against Gruber design principles","Yes","Philosophically I view a set of mappings as a dataset. We already have 2 vocabularies for expressing the relationships between a dataset and its quality assessment metadata (DQV, DAQ) and I am not 100% convinced we need another specialised vocabulary that focuses on mapping datasets. It is true there are mapping specific metadata captured here but again perhaps this could simply reuse other vocabs or be defined alone (ie without incorporating the quality metadata).","Yes","Add an appendix with sample instance data and use case","no"
