<p>
Fig. 1 shows the class interaction diagram of the ontology. The ontology describes 3 stages of mapping quality improvement. These stages are categorised as  mapping quality assessment,  mapping quality refinement and mapping quality validation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mapping quality assessment. </strong>In this stage, the mapping artefact (mqio:MappingArtefact) is assessed. The assessment activity is captured through the mqio:MappingAssessment class.
The agent who initiated the process is also captured (prov:Agent). A mapping assessment activity may have quality requirements which are captured through the mqio:QualityRequirement
class. This information allows the ontology to validate whether such quality requirements have been satisfied in the assessment and refinement stage. The ontology draws inspiration from
DQV <a href="#bib-DQV">[DQV]</a> where data quality was classified into categories (dqv:Category), dimensions (dqv:Dimension) and metrics (dqv:Metric) <a href="#bib-ZaveriEtAl">[ZaveriEtAl]</a>. 
The ontology uses the information in such classes
to generate a mapping validation report (mqio:MappingValidationReport). Each violation identified is then represented with the mqio:MappingViolation class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mapping quality refinement. </strong>This stage captures mapping refinements executed on the mapping. Each metric described using the ontology may have multiple refinements (mqio:MappingRefinement) associated with it depending on the quality aspect being measured. The refinement executed in the mapping is associated with the identified violation through the property mqio:wasRefinedBy. In addition, refinements have scores representing the likelihood the respective violation will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mapping quality validation. </strong>
Finally, the ontology provides quality information on the original mapping being assessed and the mapping which has been generated as a result of the refinement. As mentioned, each mapping assessment process may have quality requirements which can be validated at this stage. For instance, one may define a quality requirement for understandability related quality metrics to be of a particular value. In this stage, this can be validated by comparing the defined quality requirement and the resulting one. Requirements can be validated by identifying quality measurements (dqv:QualityMeasurement) associated with the quality assessment of the mapping.
