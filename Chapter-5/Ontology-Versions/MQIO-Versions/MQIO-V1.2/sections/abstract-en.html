<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Mapping Quality Improvement Ontology (MQIO) provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance and metadata information relating to the creation, quality assessment, refinement and validation of mapping artefacts used to link and generate linked data datasets. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance and metadata information for domain specific mapping languages.</span>
