<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Mapping Quality Improvement Ontology (MQIO) provides a set of classes, properties, and restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange provenance and metadata information relating to the creation, quality assessment, refinement and validation of mapping artefacts used to link and generate linked data datasets. It can also be specialized to create new classes and properties to model provenance and metadata information for domain specific mapping languages.nges that have occured within the source data of an RDF dataset. The ontology allows a notification policy to be defined which will notify users when a defined threshold of changes has been reached. Once notified the mapping and source data should be re-examined to ensure no further action is required to prevent a decrease in quality.
