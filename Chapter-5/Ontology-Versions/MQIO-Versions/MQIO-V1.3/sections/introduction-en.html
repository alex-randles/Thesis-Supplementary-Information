<p>
<strong>Fig. 1</strong> shows the class interaction diagram of the ontology. The ontology describes 3 stages of mapping quality improvement. These stages are categorised as  mapping quality assessment,  mapping quality refinement and mapping quality validation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Mapping quality assessment. </strong>In this stage, the mapping artefact (<span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingArtefact</span>) 
is assessed. The assessment activity is captured through the mqio:MappingAssessment class.
The agent who initiated the process is also captured (<span class="courier-font">prov:Agent</span>). A mapping assessment activity may have quality
 requirements which are captured through the <span class="courier-font">mqio:QualityRequirement</span>
class. This information allows the ontology to validate whether such quality requirements have been satisfied in the assessment and 
refinement stage. The ontology draws inspiration from
DQV <a href="#bib-DQV">[DQV]</a> where data quality was classified into categories  (<span class="courier-font">dqv:Category</span>), 
dimensions (<span class="courier-font">dqv:Dimension</span>) and metrics (<span class="courier-font">dqv:Metric</span>) <a href="#bib-ZaveriEtAl">[ZaveriEtAl]</a>. 
The ontology uses the information in such classes
to generate a mapping validation report (<span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingValidationReport</span>).
 Each violation identified is then represented with the <span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingViolation</span> class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mapping quality refinement. </strong>This stage captures mapping refinements executed on the mapping. 
Each metric described using the ontology may have multiple refinements (<span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingRefinement</span>) associated with it depending on the 
quality aspect being measured. The refinement executed in the mapping is associated with the identified violation through the property 
(<span class="courier-font">mqio:wasRefinedBy</span>). In addition, refinements have scores representing the 
likelihood the respective violation will be resolved.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mapping quality validation. </strong>
Finally, the ontology provides quality information on the original mapping being assessed and the mapping which has been generated 
as a result of the refinement. As mentioned, each mapping assessment process may have quality requirements which can be validated 
at this stage. For instance, one may define a quality requirement for understandability related quality metrics to be of a particular value.
In this stage, this can be validated by comparing the defined quality requirement and the resulting one.
Requirements can be validated by identifying quality measurements (<span class="courier-font">dqv:QualityMeasurement</span>) associated 
with the quality assessment of the mapping. 
</p>



<p>
It was decided to commence the process by identifying concepts and
relationships from the Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV) <a href="#bib-DQV">[DQV]</a>, which could be reused to represent relevant
information in the MQIO. DQV is a prominent ontology designed to represent quality information related to LD
datasets. The ontology contains concepts and relationships to represent quality measurements, metrics,
dimensions, categories and associated metadata. However, it was discovered that DQV reuses the PROV
Ontology (PROV-O) <a href="#bib-PROV-O">[PROV-O]</a> in order to represent activities and entities associated with the quality metadata, such as
the quality assessment process of a dataset, as DQV does not provide suitable concepts for representing related
activities and entities. PROV-O is a W3C recommendation designed to represent LD provenance and contains
concepts to represent generalized provenance related activities and entities captured in the LD domain.
Therefore, it was decided to reuse PROV-O in a similar manner to the DQV. However, it was discovered that it
would be required to extend the ontology in order to capture domain specific information required for the MQIO.
For instance, the quality assessment and refinement of a mapping are two separate activities, which should be
distinguished between in order to support sufficient interoperability. PROV-O includes a single concept to
represent general activities (<span class="courier-font">prov:Activity</span>) and it would not be possible for a machine to automatically
determine differences between information related to quality assessment and refinement activities, as these
would be represented by the same concept. Similar constraints apply to the entities (<span class="courier-font">prov:Entity</span>) involved in
the MQIO model, such as the mapping itself (<span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingArtefact</span>) 
and associated quality reports
(<span class="courier-font">mqio:MappingValidationReport</span>), which must have a distinguishable different meaning. Therefore, it
was decided to extend PROV-O in order to capture the domain specific concepts required in an ontology designed
to represent information related to the quality improvement of mappings. An ontology fully reliant on concepts
in the DQV and PROV-O would result in a semantic inoperable model, drastically limiting the ability to support
quality assessment and refinement of mappings by agents.
