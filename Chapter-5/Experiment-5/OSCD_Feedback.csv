"2023/03/16 5:35:00 PM GMT+1","Yes","It is declared and explained that the methodologies in the best practice documents and books are applied.","No","-","Yes","It's a minor issue however I would use foaf:Agent instead of dul:agent. You're not describing the person in detail why would you use an unknown or less known ontology which might not be in use in the future?","Yes","It would be nice to see more type of examples such as MoveSourceData","I assume there could be some SQL logs. Is there any possibility that you can look and put more properties into this ontology? Maybe you already did but just a thought. I would assume your ontology could be a good way to uplift SQL change logs."
"2023/03/21 9:20:28 AM GMT+1","Yes","OSCD is using well known recommendations in the ontology building space","No","methodology is sound","Yes","hasChangeData is losing the data semantics when storing as a string. In semantic applications, it is important that the data's semantics are not lost (be it a datatype e.g integer) or a URI.","Yes","The description states that this ontology is for identifying changes in an RDF datasets, however, the example shown is related to CSV changes. Whilst this might be used for both, it would be important to show how RDF changes are captured with this ontology, as it this topic is a well known problem in both academia and industry",""
"2023/03/26 10:46:06 PM GMT+1","Yes","It follows well established methods for developing and iteratively improving the concepts based on application.","No","I think the current iteration is sufficient for the task.","Yes","Some relationships are probable to have more information associated with the context. In such cases, the target of these should not be a data property, but instead should be a concept that can have more information associated with it. For example, data change being represented by a string, or by a concept called ChangedData or similar.","No","I think the current iteration is sufficient for the task.","No."
"2023/03/28 5:30:25 PM GMT+1","Yes","the documentation is comprehensive and detailed and the most relevant methodologies in the state of the art have been considered and reused.","No","it looks all complete, sound and comprehensive ","No","OSCD looks comprehensive and fit for purpose ","No","very good documentation","well done!"
"2023/04/19 12:13:26 PM GMT+1","Yes","In addition to using common methodologies it incorporates state of the art practical tools like OOPs and Widoco which impose additional requirements on ontologies.","Yes","Run the ontology through a FAIR metadata checker, test if the ontology meets Gruber's design principles https://doi.org/10.1006/ijhc.1995.1081","No","The competency question answers seem appropriate","Yes","It would be good to have an appendix with an example of use (instances and a use case)","Nice and lean. I would prefer a link to Prov:Agent instead of DUL:Agent but I suppose you inherit this from LODE and I acknowledge it is a hard choice."
